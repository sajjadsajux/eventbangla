## ✨ Key Features (Described)

  Allows users to register, log in, and log out securely using email/password. Used to control access to booking and profile pages.

- **🧭 Protected Routes (e.g. Booking Page)**  
  Certain pages like the booking page are only accessible to logged-in users. If a user isn't authenticated, they're redirected to the login page.

  Users can quickly search for events or filter them by categories like conference, workshop, or sports to find what interests them.

- **🖼️ Swiper Slider for Event Previews**  
  A swipeable slider is used to showcase featured events or event images in a smooth and interactive way.

- **🎬 AOS Animations for Scroll Effects**  
  Smooth and subtle animations appear as users scroll through the page, enhancing user engagement and visual appeal.

- **🍞 Toast Notifications**  
  Real-time messages show up (e.g., login success, errors, or booking confirmation) using small popup toasts for better UX.

- **⏳ Loading Spinners**  
  While data is being fetched or during navigation, loading animations keep users informed and improve experience.

- **📈 Animated Counters**  
  Eye-catching animated numbers display event stats, like total events, attendees, or booked seats.

- **📱 Fully Responsive UI**  
  The entire site adapts seamlessly to all screen sizes — desktop, tablet, and mobile — for a smooth browsing experience anywhere.
